"""
Data Sources
==============

API clients for biomedical databases used to build disease
causal graphs.  Each client follows the same pattern:

1. Query the database for disease-associated entities
2. Parse the response into ``GraphNode`` and ``GraphEdge`` objects
3. Handle rate limits, timeouts, and API errors gracefully
4. Return empty lists (never crash) on failure — the graph
   builder aggregates results from multiple sources

All clients use ``requests`` and are synchronous.  For
production, consider ``httpx`` with async support.
